% subroutine for eval_j


\begin{description}
  \itt{n, m, params} are passed unchanged as provided in the call to \mainroutine/\onestep.
  
  \itt{x} holds the current point $\iter{\vx}$ at which to evaluate $\sum_{i=1}^m (\vr)_i \nabla^2 r_i(\vx)$.

  \itt{r} holds $\vW\vr(\vx)$, the (weighted) residual, as computed from vector returned by the last call to \texttt{eval\_r}.

  \itt{Hf} must be set by the routine to hold the matrix $\sum_{i = 1}^m (\vr)_{i}\nabla^2\comp{r}(\iter{\vx})$, 
  held by columns as a vector, where $(\vr)_i$ denotes the $i$th component of  $\texttt{r}$, the vector passed to the routine.

  \fortranonly{
     \itt{status} is initialised to \texttt{0} before the routine is
     called. If it is set to a non-zero value by the routine, then
     \mainroutine/\onestep \ will exit with an error.
   }
\end{description}
\conly{
  \textbf{Return value:} The function should return \texttt{0} on success. A
non-zero return value will cause the least squares fitting to abort with an
error code.
