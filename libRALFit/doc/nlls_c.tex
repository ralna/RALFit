\subsection{Calling sequences}

Functions signatures are defined in a header file
\begin{verbatim}
   #include "ral_nlls.h"
\end{verbatim}
\medskip

\noindent The user callable subroutines are:
\vspace{-0.1cm}
\begin{description}
   \item[\texttt{ral\_nlls\_default\_options()}] initializes solver options to default values.
   \item[\texttt{nlls\_solve()}]  solves the non-linear least squares problem (Section~\ref{eq:nlls_problem}).
   \item[\texttt{ral\_nlls\_init\_workspace()}] initialises a workspace for use with \texttt{ral\_nlls\_iterate()}.
   \item[\texttt{ral\_nlls\_iterate()}] performs a single iteration of the solver algorithm.
   \item[\texttt{ral\_nlls\_free\_workspace()}] frees memory allocated by a call to \texttt{ral\_nlls\_init\_workspace()}.
\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% derived types %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\hsltypes
\label{derived types}
For each problem, the user must employ the derived types defined by the
module to declare scalars of the types {\tt struct ral\_nlls\_options}, and
{\tt ral\_nlls\_inform}.
The following pseudocode illustrates this.
\begin{verbatim}
   #include "ral_nlls.h"
   ...
   struct ral_nlls_options options;
   struct ral_nlls_inform inform;
   ...
\end{verbatim}
The members of these structs are explained
in Sections~\ref{typeoptions} and \ref{typeinform}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% argument lists %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\hslarguments

\subsubsection{Integer and package types}
%{\tt INTEGER} denotes default {\tt INTEGER} and
%{\tt INTEGER(long)} denotes {\tt INTEGER(kind=selected\_int\_kind(18))}.
The term {\bf package type} is used to mean \texttt{float}
if the single precision version is being used and
\texttt{double} for the double precision version.

\subsubsection{To initialise members of \texttt{struct nlls\_options} to default values}

To initialise the value of \texttt{struct nlls\_options}, the user \textbf{must} make a
call to the following suboutine (failure to do so will result in undefined behaviour):
\begin{verbatim}
   void ral_nlls_default_options(struct ral_nlls_options *options);
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
   \itt{*options} will be initialised to default values on return.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{To solve the non-linear least squares problem}
\label{sec:solve}

To solve the non-linear least squares problem make a call of the following
subroutine:

\begin{verbatim}
   void nlls_solve( int n, int m, double X[], ral_nlls_eval_r_type eval_r,
      ral_nlls_eval_j_type eval_j, ral_nlls_eval_hf_type eval_hf,
      void* params, struct nlls_options const* options, struct nlls_inform* inform,
      double weights[])
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\itt{n} holds the number $n$ of
variables to be fitted; i.e., $n$ is the length of the unknown vector $\bm x$.

\itt{m} holds the number $m$ of
data points available; i.e., $m$ is the number of functions $f_i$.
\textbf{Restriction:} \texttt{m},\texttt{n}$>$\texttt{0}

\itt{x} must hold the initial guess for $\bm x$, and on
successful exit it holds the solution to the non-linear least squares problem.

\itt{eval\_r} specifies a callback function that, given a point $\iter{\vx}$,
returns the vector $\vr(\iter{\vx})$. Details of the function signature and
requirements are are given in Section~\ref{sec::function_eval}.

\itt{eval\_j} specifies a callback function that, given a point $\iter{\vx}$,
returns the $m \times n$ Jacobian matrix, $\iter{\vJ}$, of $\vr$ at $\iter{\vx}$. Details of the function signature and requirements are are given in
Section~\ref{sec::function_eval}.

\itt{eval\_hf} is a {\tt PROCEDURE} that, given a point $\iter{\vx}$
and function $\vr(\iter{\vx})$, returns the second-order terms of the Hessian at $\iter{\vx}$.
Further details of the format required are given in Section~\ref{sec::function_eval}.

\itt{params} is a pointer to user data that is passed unaltered to the callback
functions {\tt eval\_r}, {\tt eval\_J}, and {\tt eval\_Hf}.

\itt{inform} provides information about the execution
of the subroutine, as explained in Section~\ref{typeinform}.

\itt{options} specifies options that control the execution of the subroutine,
see Section~\ref{typeoptions}.

\itt{weights} may be {\tt NULL}, otherwise it is a rank-1 array of size {\tt m}. If present, {\tt weights} holds the square-roots of the 
diagonal entries of the weighting matrix, $\vW$, in (\ref{eq:nlls_problem}).  If absent, then the norm in (\ref{eq:nlls_problem}) is taken to be the 2-norm, that is, $\vW = I$.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{To initialise a workspace for use with \texttt{ral\_nlls\_iterate()}}

Prior to the first call of \texttt{ral\_nlls\_iterate()}, the workspace must be
initialised by a call to the following subroutine:
\begin{verbatim}
   void ral_nlls_init_workspace(void **workspace);
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
   \itt{*workspace} will, on return, be allocated and initialised using Fortran intrinsics.
      To avoid a memory leak, it must be freed through a call to \texttt{ral\_nlls\_free\_workspace()}.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{To iterate once}
\label{sec:iterate}
Alternatively, the user may step through the solution process one iteration at
a time by making a call of the following form:

\begin{verbatim}
   void ral_nlls_iterate( int n, int m, double X[], void* workspace,
      ral_nlls_eval_r_type eval_r, ral_nlls_eval_j_type eval_j, ral_nlls_eval_hf_type eval_hf,
      void* params, struct nlls_options const* options, struct nlls_inform* inform,
      double weights[])
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}

\item[\normalfont \texttt{n}, \texttt{m}, \texttt{eval\_F}, \texttt{eval\_J}, \texttt{eval\_HF}, \texttt{params}, \texttt{options}, \texttt{inform}, and \texttt{weights}] are as described in Section~\ref{sec:solve}.

\itt{X} is an array of size {\tt n}. On the first call, it must hold the initial guess for
$\bm x$. On return it holds the value of $\bm x$ at the current iterate, and
must be passed unaltered to any subsequent call to \texttt{ral\_nlls\_iterate()}.

\itt{w} is workspace allocated and initialised through a previous call to
\texttt{ral\_nlls\_init\_workspace()}.

\end{description}

\subsubsection{To free a workspace when it is no longer required}

Memory allocated during the call to \texttt{ral\_nlls\_init\_workspace()} may be freed
by a call to the following subroutine:
\begin{verbatim}
   void ral_nlls_free_workspace(void **workspace);
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
   \itt{*workspace} is the workspace to be freed. On exit it will be set to \texttt{NULL}.
\end{description}


\subsection{User-supplied function evaluation routines}
\label{sec::function_eval}
In order to evaluate the function, Jacobian and Hessian at a point, the user
must supply callback functions that perform this operation that the code
{\tt ral\_nlls} will call internally.

In order to pass user-defined data into the evaluation calls, the parameter
\texttt{params} is passed unaltered to the callback functions. Typically this
will be a pointer to a user defined structure that stores the data to be fitted.

\subsubsection{For evaluating the function $\vr(\vx)$}

A subroutine must be supplied to calculate $\vr(\vx)$ for a given vector $\vx$. 
It must have the following signature:
\begin{verbatim}
  int eval_r (int n, int m, void const* params, double const* x, double* r);
\end{verbatim}

\input{eval_r.tex}

\subsubsection{For evaluating the function $J = \nabla \vr(\iter{\vx})$}
A subroutine must be supplied to calculate $J = \nabla \vr(\iter{\vx})$ for a given vector $\vx$. It must have the following signature:

\begin{verbatim}
   int eval_j (int n, int m, void const* params, double const* x, double* J);
\end{verbatim}

\input{eval_j.tex}

\subsubsection{For evaluating the function $Hf = \sum_{i=1}^m r_i(\vx) \vW  \nabla^2 \vr_i(x)$}
A subroutine must be supplied to calculate $Hf = \sum_{i=1}^m (\vr)_i \nabla^2 r_i(\vx)$ for given vectors $\vx \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\vr \in \mathbb{R}^m$; here \((\vr)_i\) denotes the $i$th component of the vector $\vr$.  
It must have the following signature

\begin{verbatim}
int eval_hf (int n, int m, void const* params, double const* x, double const* r, double* Hf);
\end{verbatim}

\input{eval_hf.tex}

\hslerrors

A successful return from a subroutine in the package is indicated by
{\tt inform.status} having the value zero.
A non-zero value is associated with an error message that by default will
be output on the Fortran unit {\tt inform.error}.  This string is also passed to the 
calling routine in {\tt inform.error\_message}.
