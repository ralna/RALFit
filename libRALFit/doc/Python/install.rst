Building the Python interface
-----------------------------

The python module is built by CMake.  The module file is generated in the ``build``
subdirectory of the folder where the ``make`` command is run from, and is installed
locally by default.

The ``distutils`` build script, ``setup.py`` is generated by CMake,
and placed in the build directory.  The routine can be installed on a system level by
issuing the command

.. code::

   python setup.py install

Note that the `ral_nlls` library, compiled from the Fortran and C code, and the
associated C headers, must be correctly installed/in the PATH for the Python module to
work.
