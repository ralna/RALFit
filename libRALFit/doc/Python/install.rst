Building the Python interface
-----------------------------

The python module is built by CMake.  The module file is generated in the ``build``
subdirectory of the folder where the ``make`` command is run from, and is installed
by default. We recommend using a virtual environment when building RALFit.

The ``setuptools`` build script, ``setup.py`` is generated by CMake,
and placed in the build directory.  The routine can be installed on a system level by
issuing the command:

.. code::

   pip install .

.. note::

    The `ral_nlls` library, compiled from the Fortran and C code, and the
    associated C headers, must be correctly installed/in the PATH for the Python module to
    work. This is done as part of the build process on non-windows systems.
