% subroutine for eval_j


\begin{description}
   \itt{n, m, params} are passed unchanged as provided in the call to
      \mainroutine/\onestep.

   \itt{x} holds the current point $\iter{\vx}$ at which to evaluate
      $\vJ(\iter{\vx})$.

   \itt{J} must be set by the routine to hold the Jacobian of the residual
      function evaluated at the current point $\iter{\vx}$, $\vr(\iter{\vx})$.
      \vecentry{J}{i*m+j} must be set to hold $\nabla_{x_j} r_i(\iter{\vx})$.

   \fortranonly{
     \itt{status} is initialised to \texttt{0} before the routine is
     called. If it is set to a non-zero value by the routine, then
     \mainroutine/\onestep \ will exit with an error.
   }
\end{description}
\conly{
  \textbf{Return value:} The function should return \texttt{0} on success. A
non-zero return value will cause the least squares fitting to abort with an
error code.
