% description of eval_r

\begin{description}
   \itt{n, m, params} are passed unchanged as provided in the call to
   \mainroutine/\onestep.

   \itt{x} holds the current point $\iter{\vx}$ at which to evaluate $\vr(\iter{\vx})$.

   \itt{r} must be set by the routine to hold the residual function
      evaluated at the current point $\iter{\vx}$, $\vr(\iter{\vx})$.

   \fortranonly{
   \itt{status} is initialised to \texttt{0} before the routine is
      called. If it is set to a non-zero value by the routine, then \newline
      \mainroutine /\onestep \
      will exit with an error.
    }
\end{description}
\conly{
\textbf{Return value:} The function should return \texttt{0} on success. A non-zero return value will cause the least squares fitting to abort with an error code.
