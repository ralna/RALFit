# RALFit

A non-linear least squares solver that is primarily developed by the Numerical Analysis group at STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory hsl@stfc.ac.uk.

The package is written in modern Fortran, and it provides a number of interfaces for other languages.

## Requirements

RALFit has been tested on Linux, although it should work on other platforms. It requires

 * a modern Fortran compiler
 * a C compiler
 * a BLAS and LAPACK distribution

### Compilation

To compile, follow the instructions in [libRALFit/README.md](libRALFit/README.md).
