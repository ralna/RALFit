A non-linear least squares solver that is primarily developed by the Numerical Analysis group at STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory hsl@stfc.ac.uk.

## Installation

### Requirements

RALFit has been tested on Linux, although it should work on other platforms.  It requires Fortran and C compilers, and BLAS and LAPACK must be installed on the system

### Compilation instructions

To compile, move to the `libRALFit` directory and issue the commands:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The package is written in modern Fortran, and we provide a number of interfaces for other languages.  For documentation, follow the links below:
