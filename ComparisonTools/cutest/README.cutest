To test NLLS examples from CUTEst:

1. Download and install CUTEst

   a) if you don't want GALAHAD as well

        http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/cutest/wiki/

   b) if you do want GALAHAD to compare with LANCELOT and/or TRU

      stable version:

        http://www.galahad.rl.ac.uk/download.html

      development version: 
      
        svn checkout http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/svn/galahad
  
      and look at the README; contact Nick Gould (nick.gould@stfc.ac.uk)
      for additional help

2. Set an environment variable RAL_NLLS to point to your RAL_nlls
   source directory. Make sure that you have ral_nlls available as
   a random library, libral_nlls.a

3. Move to a directory containing SIF least-squares examples, and
   use the runcutest command to interface to ral_nlls. For example,

     runcutest --package ral_nlls --architecture pc64.lnx.gfo --decode RAT43.SIF

   see the man page for ral_nlls for options

   If you have installed GALAHAD, you can

     sdgal pc.lnx.gfo lanb RAT43.SIF   (nonlinear equation formulation)
     sdgal pc.lnx.gfo lanb RAT43LS.SIF (nlls formulation)

   or

     sdgal pc.lnx.gfo tru RAT43LS.SIF  (nlls formulation only)
